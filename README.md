# Tiny-Q

    Tiny-Q is a minimal framework to show quantum computation basics in a tensor/matrix perspective view.

The main difference from existing framesworks is that, 
we distinguish operations by different python operator to make formula syntax more clear :)

```python
# use mul * for gate composition
# u = Gate * Gate
u = X * H

# use pipe | for gate application
# q = Gate | State
q = X | v0

# use matmul @ for system expansion (gate/state tensor product)
#u = Gate @ Gate
u = H @ I
#q = State @ State
q = v0 @ v1

# use > for measurements
# r = State > Measure, single measure
r = H | v0 > Measure
# r = State > Measure(count), bunch measure
r = CNOT * (H @ I) | State.zero(2) > Measure(1000)
# p = State > State, project by state
p = v0 > h0
# p = State > MeasureOp, project by measure operator
p = h0 > M0
```

```python
class State:
  .n_qubits -> int
  .is_pure -> bool
  .zero()                       # alloc |0>s
  .one()                        # alloc |1>s
  .amp -> np.ndarray            # amplitude
  .prob -> np.ndarray           # probabilty distribution
  .plot_prob()                  # plot probabilty distribution
  .density -> np.ndarray        # density matrix
  .plot_density()               # plot density matrix
  .trace -> float               # trace of density matrix
  .__eq__() -> bool             # state equality (ignoring global phase)
  .__matmul__() -> State        # v0 @ v1, state expansion
  .__gt__() -> str              # v0 > Measure|Measure()|State|MeasureOp, various measurements
  .info()                       # quick show info

class Gate:
  .n_qubits -> int
  .is_unitary -> bool           # unitary (should always be True)
  .is_hermitian -> bool         # hermitian (True for most gates)
  .__eq__() -> bool             # gate equality
  .__pow__() -> Gate            # H**alpha, gate self-power
  .__mul__() -> Gate            # X * H: gate composition
  .__matmul__() -> Gate         # X @ H: gate expansion
  .__or__() -> State            # X | v0: gate application
  .info()                       # quick show info
```
